# Kisan_Mitra_Center

Hello everyone , I am sandeep mishra from ‘Int eligeence= 100’ team with team admin Amresh prasad sinha and team members Sandeep mishra, Bharat kumar & shiv shankar.
We have made our hackathon on theme “Agritech”.Since we all born in India which is the land of agriculture, but we all know that most of the youth in india are not moving towards agriculture sector and not willing to do farming and they underrate farming though
But when we deep analysis this fact we found that there are also so many other youth who are very curious towards farming and want to do farming but they didn’t get any good resource on how to do farming and they didn’t have too money to buy equipments online and they also feel lack of knowledge.
So on this problem our team decided to make a webportal which can help which can sort all of these problems in ‘Kisan Mitra Center’

Kisan mitra center firstly find in which state did you leave because in india soil varies from place to place and weather also differs, so a crop which can be grown in haryana may not be able to grown in karnataka
So when we select our state we firstly describes the viewer that which crop is suitable for your state for an example suppose I live in a state so call Uttar pradesh so I will get a list of crops which are most suitable in my state like …
This will help me to check which crop should I grow
On the right side there is a option to get all the Official infromations like state government orders, insurances and many too
Now suppose a farmer want to grow sugarcane so when we select sugarcane a new page comes which defines how can I grow sugarcane
It firstly defines with the basic Introduction,history, its importance & modern day problems
And we have also added an option of youtube video too so that a farmer can easily get to know how to do farming if not willing to read so
This video will explain each and everything regarding the crop

Now the problem arises I am willing to farm sugarcane but from where will I get seeds, fertilizers etc.,
So we have made an online shopping platform too which is under ’atmanirbhar Bharat ’ mission
Under this when we select buy seeds we will be directed to a new page like that and on this page we have to enter our pincode, we have to enter pincode so that we can get local sellers nearby my location which will be beneficial to both local farmer as well as shopkeeper.This will also profitises the shopkeeper 
Now similarly we can search for fertilizers too like …………… enetering pincode and so on
Now suppose we grow our crops then the problem arises where should I sell it or how can I sell my crops
So we have created a portal for that too and all the portals are very alike and easier for any farmer to use
Now the same function we have to do we have to enter our pincode and then we can easily choose a buyer and call then directly
This will make farmer confident that he or she can sell their crops too on that same portal
But suppose a situation in which a farmer has to leave his home for many months due to some urgency or has to be shifted to place where he can’t do farming
So what will happen to his farm, for that we have made a portal call ‘rent your farm ’ in which there will be some farmers which do not have any land to do farming but can do farming on any other field for their surviving so lets open it too here the same process occurs and we will enter our pincode and then the same way it will pop up some farmers name

Thus this portal will not aimed to help farmers, shopkeers only there are some studies too like we have made modern agriculture page too on which farmer or any student can get all information
And also there is a page on agriculture edn too from which a student willing to study education can get to know how to procedd

Thus this initiave under aatm nirbhar abhiyan will help not only the farmers but also students, shopkeeper, sellers, landless farmers and others. This portal will help our nation to grow tooo. Thank you
